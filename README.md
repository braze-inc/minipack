# Minipack

Forked from [nikushi/minipack](https://github.com/nikushi/minipack) until [#42](https://github.com/nikushi/minipack/pull/42) and [#46](https://github.com/nikushi/minipack/pull/46) land. Once they're merged we can delete this fork.

Note for future readers: Minipack (and especially the parts of Minipack we actually use) is really small, basically just a ruby api for reading a json file and creating some html tags. Upstream seems abandoned, so for any dramatic changes it might be easier to just fold this code into platform.
